                <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
                    <li><b>1933</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
                        University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era
                        program known as the "National Youth Administration"
                    </li>
                    <li><b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money.
                        Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping
                        starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he
                        said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
                    <li><b>1937</b> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US
                        Forestry Service</li>
                    <li><b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets
                        laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles
                        Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman,
                        who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl
                        Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military
                        asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to
                        control malaria, disenfectants, and other </li>
                    <li><b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant
                        Pathology</li>
                    <li><b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,
                        leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico
                        to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next
                        16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of
                        disease resistent wheat - including different
                        varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
                    <li><b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season,
                        doubling wheat yields</li>
                    <li><b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
                        with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain
                        that responds well to fertalizer. It goes on to provide
                        95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
                    <li><b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding
                        strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time
                        to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly
                        expanding population</li>
                    <li><b>1970</b> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
                    <li><b>1983</b> - helps seven African countries dramatically
                        increase their maize and sorghum yields</li>
                    <li><b>1984</b> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M
                        University</li>
                    <li><b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the world food
                        supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified
                        crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we
                        run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not
                        inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
                        modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long
                        before we called it science, people were selecting
                        the best breeds."
                    </li>
                    <li><b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
